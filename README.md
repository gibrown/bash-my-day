# bash-my-day
A set of bash scripts to get me on task and keep me moving.

Mac OS X only. Relies heavily on the `say` command and `osascript` commands for controlling applications.

The interesting functions are all in `timed-functions.sh`. Otherwise it is up to personal preference and whatever clever tricks you can come up with to optimize your time. If you want a place to start from I suggest `bash-morning.sh`. That is the script I use the most.

Personally I find that this sort of scripting gives me a lot less to think about during the morning. My equivalent to Obama's only having one suit so he doesn't need to make a decision. I can also do things like script up links to recent code changes by everyone on my team, or every dashboard that I want to review for performance. I find having that sort of thing in a text file much easier to maintain than putting it into browser bookmarks.
