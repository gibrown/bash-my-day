# bash-my-day
A set of bash scripts to get me on task and keep me moving.

Mac OS X only. Relies heavily on the `say` command and `osascript` commands for controlling applications.

The interesting functions are all in `timed-functions.sh`. Otherwise it is up to personal preference and whatever clever tricks you can come up with to optimize your time. Personally I find that this sort of scripting gives me a lot less to think about during the morning. My equivalent to Obama's only having one suit so he doesn't need to make a decision.
